Optometry: The equipment has been touched by a thousand faces. You know where this is going.

Speleology: Cave walls are surprisingly lickable and geologists do it regularly. The bats, however, object.

Pomology: It's literally the study of fruit. This is the most lickable science. Go nuts.

Oenology: This entire field is just professional licking with better vocabulary.

Zymology: Fermentation science. You've been licking this every weekend. It licks back at 40 proof.

Tribology: The study of friction. Your tongue will provide excellent data. Too much data. Stop.
